JUnit 4:

- Purpose: 
   - JUnit 4 is testing framework
  
- Annotations: 
   - It uses annotations to define test methods and control the test flow, such as `@Test`, `@Before`, `@After`, `@BeforeClass`, `@AfterClass`, and `@Ignore`.

- Test Case Structure:
   - A test case is a class containing one or more test methods. Each test method is annotated with `@Test`.

- Assertions:
   - JUnit 4 provides a set of assertion methods like `assertEquals`, `assertTrue`, `assertFalse`, etc., to check expected results.

- Test Lifecycle:
   - Methods annotated with `@Before` and `@After` are executed before and after each test method, respectively. `@BeforeClass` and `@AfterClass` are executed once before and after all test methods in a class.

- Test Suites:
   - You can group multiple test classes into a test suite using `@RunWith` and `@Suite` annotations.

- Parameterized Tests:
   - JUnit 4 supports parameterized tests using the `@RunWith(Parameterized.class)` annotation.

- Exception Handling:
   - You can test expected exceptions using the `@Test` annotation with the `expected` parameter.

- Categories:
   - Tests can be categorized using `@Category` annotations to selectively run specific groups of tests.

- Assumptions:
   - JUnit 4 provides `Assume` class for making assumptions about the conditions necessary for a test to run.

- IDE Integration:
   - Integrated with IDEs like Eclipse and IntelliJ, making it easy to run and debug tests.

JUnit 4 is a foundational tool for unit testing in Java, allowing developers to ensure that individual units of code behave as expected. If you have specific questions or need further details, feel free to ask.
