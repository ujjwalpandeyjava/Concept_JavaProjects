## Thread pool

Basically a way of handling multiple threads at same time.

- ThreadPool: pool of worker threads that are efficiently managed to execute tasks.
- Using a thread pool can improve performance by reusing existing threads rather than creating new ones for every task.
- Example using the ExecutorService and Executors classes in ThreadPool.java
