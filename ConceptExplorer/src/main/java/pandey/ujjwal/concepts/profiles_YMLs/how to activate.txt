There are several ways to activate a profile in Spring Boot:

1. **Programmatically**: 
	You can programmatically set active profiles by calling `SpringApplication.setAdditionalProfiles(...)` before your application runs. It's also possible to activate profiles using Spring’s `ConfigurableEnvironment` interface.

2. **Using a Property**: 
	The `spring.profiles.active` is a standard property that Spring Boot will pick up automatically to activate a profile. Pass the profile name to this property value to activate that profile. If you want to activate multiple profiles then you can pass comma-separated names of those profiles.

3. **Using an Environment Variable**: 
	You can set an environment variable named `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE` to specify which profiles are active¹.

4. **Using a Command Line Argument**: 
	When starting your application, you can use a command line argument to specify the active profiles, like so: `--spring.profiles.active=dev,hsqldb`¹.

5. **Using the `@Profile` Annotation**: 
	You can use the `@Profile` annotation on your configuration classes or methods to indicate they should be used only when a certain profile or profiles are active¹.

The last profile added gets the highest precedence.
